#first run

first start preferable with the minimum parameters

2 - "$ number_of_threads" = 4 >> start with 4 browsers, 25% of 4 = 1 then run 4 browsers (1> by playlist, 1> by search 1> by save> 1 by album) 
3 - "$ country" = 1 >> for all countries
4 - "$ id_playlist_album" = 2 >> get playlist that have id = 2 from databases (this parameter for album)

#information

- The robot is an automation tool, for autoplay platform "spotify" only, in this version.
- this robot takes its parameters via a sql database
- the robot is tested on a linux server of 4gb on ram by 8 - 10 threads (preferable 8)
- the robot provided history consult the link log> (I own)

#to improve

1 - the data requested on the database per hours are limited by the database providers that I used in this version
2 - large numbers of spotify accounts provided are not valid (to launch a large number of plays it takes a large number of accounts)
3 - some proxy are not fast enough or are not listening at the time of the request (in this case the robot switches to the other)
